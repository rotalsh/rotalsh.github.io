I uploaded the English cover of "Dooly the Little Dinosaur" here: [link](https://youtu.be/3cwlhcqzKHU)  

I used the instrumentals I had from 3 years ago when I made my grade 12 project and sang over it! Thankfully, the files were saved on the computer and all I had to do was transfer it to a USB to put my voice over it. I translated the lyrics to English when I had time - I had to think about how to best to balance getting the meaning accurate vs. matching the syllables & flow. I'm not sure if what I did was the best but I'm satisfied with it.  

The recording was really easy. All I did was sing through the lyrics once for each verse and that was it! I remembered the entire project being time-consuming 3 years ago, when there was a lot more things to do when it came to audio editing. I was able to use my hard work from back then to significantly reduce my efforts this time.

Hope you enjoy.
