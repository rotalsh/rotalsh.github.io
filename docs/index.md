Hello. My name is Jaehwan Seok and this is my website. You can find my blog posts and games here (eventually). Check out my [other projects](https://github.com/rotalsh/), 
[my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaehwan-seok-ba72a6217/), and my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@rotalsh). You can also check out the repository for the website here: [repo](https://github.com/rotalsh/rotalsh.github.io).

I'm a Computer Science and Math student at UBC. I really enjoy playing video games and coding, and I love to learn new things. 
You can contact me at [jaehwan.seok@ubc.ca](mailto:jaehwan.seok@ubc.ca).
